# Horner Bot

A server running on a raspberry pi that controls a laser to play with Horner (my cat). The laser can be controlled manually (through a simple web interface) or automatically (using the YOLO object detection model to detect the cat's location and speed in real time). The interface also includes a live video feed from the rpi.

Built with Flask and socket.io on a Raspberry Pi with a Hailo AI acceleration module.
